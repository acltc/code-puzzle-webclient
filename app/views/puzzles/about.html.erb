    <strong>Where do the Puzzler puzzles come from?</strong><br>
      Puzzler currently uses puzzles from <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>. It collects the puzzles through an API developed for Project Euler by the 2014 summer cohort of the <a href="http://anyonecanlearntocode.com/">Anyone Can Learn to Code</a> Bootcamp in Chicago, IL. Puzzler <em>itself</em> is also a project of that bootcamp. We hope you enjoy the puzzles!<br>

    <strong>What are you going to do with my e-mail address?</strong><br>
      Literally nothing. It's just a convenient way for you to sign in.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>How is the puzzle difficulty rating decided?</strong><br>
      The puzzle difficulty rating is based on real people trying out the puzzles. It represents the number of times a puzzle have been solved successfully out of the number of times it has been attempted. That's why some of them are "uncharted territory"â€”no one has tried them yet. You can be the first!
